# robot vision
This repository contains the **vision part** of the robot project of "_Intelligent Robots Design and Implementation_" course of E.E, Tsinghua University, which is also what I mainly contributed to in this project.

I opened this standalone project because this vision module was designed to be **test-friendly**, **extensible** and **independent** from the other code of the robot project. Also, after seeing some of my classmates struggling with their code because of poor abstraction, messy structure and unfamiliarity with OpenCV, I wanted to share my solution and also help students who take this course later quickly get started with the course project.

You can view the whole project at [RainEggplant/robot-terror-drone](https://github.com/RainEggplant/robot-terror-drone) if interested. However, I DO NOT recommend using this project directly.
